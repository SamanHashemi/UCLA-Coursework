I used the predicate ambiguous(5,C,T1,T2). for my Towers puzzle.

This resulted in the following ambiguous puzzle.
C = counts([4,2,3,2,1],[2,2,1,4,3],[5,3,2,1,3],[1,2,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[4,5,2,3,1],[5,3,1,2,4],[3,4,5,1,2]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[4,5,2,3,1],[5,3,1,2,4],[2,4,5,1,3]]

I got a speedup value of 1.2167364016736402
