One of the first things that is see is a history log of all the past commits that have been made. It shows layout of the repository and the branches that it has.

I also see a list of all people who has committed in the past, with their commits and emails listed. 

We also notices all the dates for the commits listed to the right of the window mentioned above.

One the left at the very bottom there is a window showing the file changes as if it were a diff file. 

Above that we have more information from the change long and information about the author.

Finally above that we have even more information with information about the Commit id number and some relevant info to that commit, its parent, child, branches, master and committer.
