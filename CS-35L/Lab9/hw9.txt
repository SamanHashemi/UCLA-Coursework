Lab 9 HW

2) I moved into the diffutils directory and I used the git checkout to create a branch called quote with the following command:

git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3) I moved the file quote-3.0-patch.txt

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

Which outputs:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c


5) For each file above I ran C-x 4 a in emacs and exited with saving.

6) I now have a changelog folder that I can commit and print out using these commands:

git add .
git commit -aF src/ChangeLog

which results in the following:

7) I ran git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt 


8) I ran "git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'" to create a new branch for my partner and then renamed it to "jane-formatted-patch.txt" then I did "git am jane-formatted-patch.txt" 

9) I did the same commands as in the lab:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

Then I ran "make distdir" went to 


10) I go into the eggert dir by "cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs" and ran the command "gitk" to find a GUI that popped up which I took a screenshot of on my computer and saved as "gitk-screenshot.png"
