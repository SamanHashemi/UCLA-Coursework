SRFROB Lab 5

When we run the time commands we can see that there is a clear difference in the times that it takes each specific program to run. Lets take a look at the result of the following below for a text file with 100 lines.

time ./sfrobu < test.txt
real	0m0.004s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.003s


time ./sfrobu -f < test.txt
real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.002s

time ./sfrobs < test.txt
real	0m0.008s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.007s

time ./sfrobs -f < test.txt
real	0m0.012s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.009s


Each of these times give us some deeper insight into each of the time comparisons. To go over the whole thing briefly (although it was not specified, this is for my own understanding) we see that we notice that the shell scripts seem to have slower times to run. This is (primarily) due to the fact that they are running in bash which is slower to run than their C counterparts. This is to be expected and it can be assumed that everything is running correctly
