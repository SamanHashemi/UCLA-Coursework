1. The shell command  man - k printf is the command to print all commands that have some specific word in their man descriptions.
2. They are both found under /u/cs/ugrad/saman I used pwd name to find their directory on my machine
3. The following commands are the one character commands and their functionality
: - No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments
              and  performing any specified redirections. A zero exit code is
              returned
. - execute a function
w - shows which users are logged in  an what they are doing
[ - 
X - Nothing important but shows up w/ find command
4. The file that is actually executed is /etc/alternatives/emacs. I found this using the readlink command
5. The version number for emacs under bin and regualr is 24.3.1 and was found using the usr/bin/emacs -version and emacs -version commands respectively
6. g+s gives the person accessing the file permission from the group. o-x removes the permissions for others for the files.
7. I used the command find /usr/local/cs -type d -ctime -30.
8. Because find is in the usr/bin/ directory (found using whereis find) I had to move to that directory and perform the ls -l | grep ^l | wc ls is used to list all the directories grep ^l makes a not l find and the wc prints the number of instances which was 271.
9. using the man ls we find that -lt lists everything by time and we see that librom1394.so.0.3.0 is the oldest file in the specified directory 
10.  man locale gives the information we need and we see that the data is being taken from the usr/share/i18n/locales
11. We use the C-h a to search and find that the two commands with downcase in their names are
 downcase-region
downcase-word
12.
C-M-r isearch-backward-regexp <Do incremental search backward for regular expression.>
C-M-s isearch-forward-regexp <Do incremental search forward for regular expression.>
C-M-t transpose-sexps <Like \[transpose-words] but applies to sexps.>
C-M-u backward-up-list  <go uplist backward>
C-M-v scroll-other-window <scroll to the other window>
C-M-w append-next-kill <kill next program>
13. The C-g commands executes a quit during lisp code and signals a quit otherwise (found using a C-h b and a search for the C-g command until a C-h a to search for the C-g command action from the corresponding name
14. yank is a like a C-v (paste) in windows and mac. It allows the user to paste the item they want to paste. This can be done using a copy M-w or a copy C-w and a paste (yank) C-y
15. The only notable difference is that the dired command give the current and parent directory when listing.
