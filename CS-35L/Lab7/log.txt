This lab was fairly straight forward and I completed it using the following procedure.

First I had to connect my BB to the internet using the command "sudo connmanctl" this brought me to a shell where I had to input the following.

connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services 
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1068f05_55434c415f5745425f524553_managed_none
connmanctl> quit


I to then download the following files using the commands:

sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

I then had to check to see what my ip address is which was found using the command "ifconfig":

172.29.83.135

I then had to create a keygen and I ran it using the command:

ssh-keygen

I saved it in the directory /root/.ssh/

It printed the fingerprint and the randomart.

I then made a server on my computer for my partner by doing the following commands:

sudo useradd -d /home/janel -m janel
sudo passwd janel
cd /home/janel
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R janel .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .sssh

I then had to make a server on my partners computer

I did this by having them use the commands:
sudo useradd -d /home/samanh -m samanh
sudo passwd samanh
cd /home/samanh
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R samanh .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then had to change the passauth to no using the command:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

My partner then ran the command "ifconfig" to get me her address. Once this was all set up I was able to run the command

ssh samanh@172.29.83.135

After this was all over I then had to remove the password requirement which I did with the following:

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i samanh@172.29.83.135
ssh-add

This was the last step and we check to see that everything is working by running the command

ssh -X samanh@172.29.83.135

xterm

which opens an xterm shell window. Lastly, I had Jane (my partner) check to see if this was working by running the command:
ps aux

where she saw that there was a section called xterm with me as the user.
