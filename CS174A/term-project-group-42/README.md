Final Project: Volleyball

## Group Members
Brittany Hsu, Luca Matsumoto, Saman Hashemipour


## What is it?
Our project is a 3D rendition of the incredibly popular childrens game Neopets Volleyball. By simply moving the monkies around on their side of the field they use their heads to hit the ball up and have it come crashing down in an attempt to defeat their opponent. Once the ball falls on the other side of the net the player gets a point.


## Contributions
Luca Matsumoto: Created all the designs for the players, net, field, ball, and surrounding boundries, designed physics functions, collision detection

Brittany Hsu: Worked on the physics and the collision detection so that they ball will bounce properly when it collides with something.

Saman Hashemipour: Worked on the physics for the ball to help it move properly


## Gameplay Features
We added some neat features to our game to spice things up.
1) standing in the same place all of the time will not work as we coded a slide offset to change how far the ball goes.
2) You can move the camera around to your own liking.
3) Scores go up to 25, and you may play as many sets as you wish.

## How to use our application
Rules to the game
1) Normal Volleyball: If the ball hits the net or goes out of bounds or hits the floor, the opposing player gets the point
2) While the ball is on your side, before you hit the ball, if you press the "k" or "s" keys, you can hit the ball harder. The ball will be hit with a larger force until turned off with the "s" or "l" keys before hitting the ball (on the same side)
3) You can use the "b" key to reset the position of the ball and the "d" key to start the game
4) The key descriptions are displayed

## Key notes
1) Remember that you can only register/cancel hard hits when the ball is on your side of the net and before you hit the ball
2) Once a ball hits the net or goes out of bounds, the game will automatically reset the ball.
